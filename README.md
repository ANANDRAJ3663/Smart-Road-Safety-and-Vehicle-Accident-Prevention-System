Whenever the vehicle is travelling at a safer distance, green LED will glow indicating that the vehicle is at safer distance and displaying “No Danger Maintain Pace”. If the vehicle is going closer to an obstacle like a wall or another vehicle then the yellow LED will glow indicating that vehicle is getting closer to obstacle and displays “Danger ahead, slow down the speed” and continuously gives a beep sound until the vehicle comes at safer distance. If the vehicle doesn’t slow down then red LED glows displaying “Extreme danger, apply brakes” and high beep sound will be produced alerting the driver until it gets at a safe distance.
